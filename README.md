# AI-Implementation-to-Walmart

Team project for my Design Thinking module: prototyped and analysed the bussiness impact of an AI app on the supermarket Walmart. The app uses a reccommendation
alghoritm to reccommend foods in more nutritive categories to preganant women shopping at Walmart. 

- scoping the problem in the food system and reducing it to micronutrient malnutrition for pregnant women in the US
- carrying out extensive research about the existing AI technologies in supermarkets and categorised them according to McKinsey
- using design techniques to reach a solution: carried out 12 interviews that allowed us to build the user personas and customer journeys,
used brainstorm and scamper techniques to find a solution, created an interactive prototype of our application and tested it on users, then incorporated the feedback
- analysing the businees impact of our app, the potential costs and implementation issues
